### Hello!
##### skills

I'm a beginner developer that knows Lua, JS (Node.js and browser), and Go. I really like automating random stuff and making websites for random stuff!
##### Projects

Some of my projects include multiple Roblox games, various websites, local Go programs, and more stuff like that. Almost all of my online profiles go under the name AsyncBanana.
#### Random stuff

I never actually realized you could do this until seeing the Github stand at CodeLand
I don't really know what to write here, but I will probably add more soon!
##### ðŸ‘‹Bye!
